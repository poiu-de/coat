Coat provides three annotations, a type-level annotation `@Coat.Config` and
two method-level annotations `@Coat.Param` and `@Coat.Embedded`.
The annotations are mandatory, but `@Coat.Param` and `@Coat.Embedded` are
mutual exclusive.


### @Coat.Config

Each interface that should be processed by the annotation processor must be
annotated with `@Coat.Config`.

The generated class will always be generated in the same package as the
annotated interface.

The name of the generated class is by the default the interface name with
`Immutable` prepended to it. One exception is if the interface name starts with
an underscore. In that case the generated class name is the same as the
interface, but with the leading underscore removed. Therefore for the interface
`_MyConfig` the generated class would be `MyConfig`.

`@Coat.Config` supports a single parameter `className` that can be specified to
generate a class with a different name than when applying the above
mentioned naming rules. When `className` is specified it will be used as
the generated class name. It will still be generated in the same package as
the annotated interface.

```java
@Coat.Config(className = "MyAppConfig")
public interface AppConfig {
  â€¦
}
```

### @Coat.Param

Each accessor method in the annotated interface must be annotated with
`@Coat.Param`.

The mandatory parameter `key` specifies the name of the key
as it must be specified in the config file (or the `Properties` or `Map`
object with which the config class is instantiated).

An optional parameter `defaultValue` can be specified to define a default
value that will be used if the config key is missing in the config file.
The default value must be specified as a String in the same form it would
be specified in the config file. For example:

```java
@Coat.Param(key = "port", defaultValue = "8080")
public int port();
```

The generated config would return the value that was specified in the
config file or `8080` if no port was specified.

### @Coat.Embedded

When using [nested configurations](./02_nesting_configurations) the
annotation `@Coat.Embedded` must be used instead of `@Coat.Param` on the
corresponding accessor method.

When using `@Coat.Embedded` the return type of the accessor method _must_
be a `@Coat.Config` annotated interface.

The mandatory parameter `key` specifies the prefix for the config
parameters of the embedded config.

An optional parameter `keySeparator` can be specified to define the
separator between the prefix and the actual config key of the embedded
config. It defaults to a single dot.

```java
@Coat.Embedded(key = "mqtt", keySeparator = "-")
public MqttConfig mqtt();
```
