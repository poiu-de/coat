title: "Roadmap"
---

Coat is a project in its early stages. There are some features that are
planned, but not yet implemented.

This roadmap lists some features that should be supported in future
versions of Coat.

Be aware that this is just a "vision" of Coats future. That some feature is
listed in this roadmap does not necessarily mean that it will definitly be
implemented. It may even be that some feature is planned in this roadmap
even it is technically not possible to implement.

Of course, contributions are welcome to support more features in the
future. In any case, before starting to implement a feature, discuss it on
[the Github issue page](https://github.com/poiu-de/coat/issues) to avoid
wasted effort due to duplicate work or differing ideas of how a feature
should be implemented.
