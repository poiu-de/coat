- The `@Coat.Param` annotation is now optional. All methods in an interface
  with the `@Coat.Config` annotation are considered now. The “key” will be
  inferred from the accessor method name if missing. 

  To influence the style of the inferred keys a `CasingStrategy` can be
  specified.

- Arrays and Collection types are now supported.

- Converters are provided for “boxed” primitives now.

- Converters can be specified declaratively on the annotation level now
  (on `@Coat.Config` and `@Coat.Param` level). The same is true for ListParsers
  for the new collection types.

- Allow underscores in numbers for better readablity.

- Ignore non-Coat annotations instead of producing broken code.

- Allow stripping a “get” prefix from the accessor name when inferring
  the “key”.
