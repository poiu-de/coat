- Use `java.lang.System.Logger` instead of `java.util.logging.Logger` in
  CoatConfig.

- Correctly handle inherited accessor methods from multiple interfaces. 

  Accessor methods that are totally equal will only be generated once.
  Accessor methods that have the same name, but are otherwise not totally
  equal (e.g. differing return type or differing default value) prevent the
  generation.

- Check that the same key is not used for different accessor methods.

- Don't try to generate a config from an interface which has methods that
  return void or accept parameters (as they can't be used as accessors).

- Add support for Boolean objects (as opposed to privimitive booleans).

- Correctly handle numeric values in hexadecimal, binary and octal
  notation.
