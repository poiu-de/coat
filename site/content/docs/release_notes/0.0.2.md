- `CoatConfig#validate()` now checks whether config values can be converted
  to their corresponding type.

- The generated config classes now provide a method `writeExampleConfig` to
  write an example config (in a syntax valid for Java .properties files) to
  a provided Writer.

- The annotation processor now generates an example `.properties` file for
  each annotated interface.

- The annotation processor now adds an `equals()` and `hashCode()`
  method to each generated class.

- A new annotation `@Coat.Embedded` is provided to allow embedding
  `@Code.Config` annotated interfaces in other `@Coat.Config` annotated
  interfaces. This allows for better reusablity of config classes and
  improved readability.
