Coat has no runtime dependencies on other libraries.

The annotation processor has some dependencies on other libraries (which is
why it is recommended to use maven as it resolves those dependencies
automatically), but none of them are needed at runtime.

<!-- FIXME: Should we change this requirement? -->
Coat can be used with Java 11 or higher.
